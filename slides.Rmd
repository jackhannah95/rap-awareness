## Setting a margin in RStudio

- It's possible to set a margin in RStudio, to give an indication of when code should be split over multiple lines


- To set the margin, go to Tools -> Global Options -> Code -> Display -> tick the 'Show margin' box


- It defaults to 80 characters, but that can be changed

## Slide title

```{r out.width = "70%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("images/value.png")
```

## This slide has two columns 
<!-- It seems easier to do with htmltags than with other ways --> 
<div style="float: left; width: 50%; text-align: left">
* Bullet point
* Bullet point with *italic text*
* Bullet point with **bold text**
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'right'}
hist(rnorm(100))
```
</div>
